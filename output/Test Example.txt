[14:51:15]  But not do But not do this.
[14:51:15] Okay.
[14:51:16] Here we But not do this.
[14:51:16] Okay.
[14:51:16] Here we go.
[14:51:17] Most of Could not do this.
[14:51:17] Okay.
[14:51:17] Here we go.
[14:51:18] Most developers could stop Could not do this.
[14:51:18] Okay.
[14:51:18] Here we go.
[14:51:20] Most developers could stop coding as soon as coding as soon as AI takes over.
[14:51:21] Know, I'm not gonna lie to Know, I'm not gonna lie to you.
[14:51:22] This this sound Know, I'm not gonna lie to you.
[14:51:23] This this sound this sounds like Know, I'm not gonna lie to you.
[14:51:23] This this sound this sounds like actual copium.
[14:51:24] This Know, I'm not gonna lie to you.
[14:51:26] This this sound this sounds like actual copium, the same kind of copium actual copium, the same kind of copium that goes like this.
[14:51:26] actual copium, the same kind of copium that goes like this.
[14:51:27] You know, once fusion actual copium, the same kind of copium that goes like this.
[14:51:28] You know, what's fusion energy?
[14:51:29] Takes over you know, Takes over you know what I mean?
[14:51:30] This is the Takes over you know what I mean?
[14:51:31] This is the same.
[14:51:35] Oh, dude, when Fuchs Oh, dude, when fusion energy, when Oh, dude, when fusion energy, when AI takes over, Oh, dude, when fusion energy, when AI takes over, what's what's what's the other good ones?
[14:51:36] what's what's the other good ones?
[14:51:43] Oh, when those hydrogen Oh, when those hydrogen engines finally Oh, when those hydrogen engines finally land and we can all have Oh, when those hydrogen engines finally land and we can all have flying cars, dude, hoverboard is dude, hoverboard is just right around the dude, hoverboard is just right around the corner.
[14:51:43] It's so close.
[14:51:44] It's so It's so close.
[14:51:44] It's so close, bro.
[14:51:45] Just It's so close.
[14:51:45] It's so close, bro.
[14:51:46] Just just one more decade, It's so close.
[14:51:46] It's so close, bro.
