[14:51:15] But not do this.  
[14:51:15] Okay.  
[14:51:16] Here we go.  
[14:51:17] Most developers could stop coding as soon as AI takes over.  
[14:51:21] I'm not going to lie to you.  
[14:51:23] This sounds like actual copium.  
[14:51:26] This is the same kind of copium that goes like this:  
[14:51:27] You know, once fusion energy takes over. You know what I mean?  
[14:51:31] This is the same.  
[14:51:35] Oh, dude, when fusion energy and AI take over, what are the other good ones?  
[14:51:43] Oh, when those hydrogen engines finally land and we can all have flying cars, dude, hoverboards are just right around the corner.  
[14:51:44] It's so close, bro.  
[14:51:46] Just one more decade.
